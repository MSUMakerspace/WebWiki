# Routers

Routers are some of the most useful tools in the woodworking field.
Different cutters may be used to provide a variety of cutting and shaping operations such as ‐
slotting, mortising, dadoing, grooving, rabbeting, corner‐rounding, beading, dovetailing,
veining, inlay work, etc.

## Safety

* Eye protection is required when using these tools.
* Do not talk with observers while operating these tools.
* Be sure switch is “OFF” before plugging in.
* The use of hearing protection is encouraged when using this tool.
* The use of a dust mask is encouraged when using this tool.
* Loose clothing, hair and or jewelry should be removed, tucked back and or restrained.
* Select proper bit for work to be done.
* Always be sure the collet nut is securely tightened to prevent the router bit from slipping during use.
* Make certain that the work piece is rigidly held in desired position and free of obstructions and always hold the router firmly and against the work, using both hands.
* Remove material in increments (successive passes) if cut will exceed 1/8” in width or depth of cut. Keep cutting pressure constant. Do not force tool into cut.
* Never adjust depth of cut while motor is running.
* Be sure cord is free and will not “hang up” during routing operations.
* Keep hands clear of cutter when motor is running to prevent personal injury.
* Maintain firm grip on router when starting motor to resist starting torque. Allow motor to come to full speed before contacting work piece.
* Be sure motor has completely stopped before setting machine down.

## Procedure

Before using your router, consider the kind and total amount of material to be removed. Depending on the material, it may be necessary to make more than one cut to avoid overloading the motor. Before beginning the cut on the actual workpiece, it is advisable to make a sample cut on a piece of scrap lumber. This will show exactly how the cut will look as well as enable you to check dimensions. Always be sure the work is rigidly clamped or otherwise secured before making a cut. Generally speaking, when working on a bench, the workpiece should be held on the bench by wood clamps. When routing edges, the router should be held firmly down and against the work by both guiding knobs. Since the cutter rotates clockwise (when viewing router from top), more efficient cutting will be obtained if
the router is moved from left to right as you stand facing the work. When working on the inside of a template, move router in a clockwise direction. When working on the outside of a template, move the router in a counterclockwise direction. The speed and depth of cut will depend largely on the type of material being worked upon. Keep the cutting pressure constant, but do not crowd the router so the motor speed slows excessively. It may be necessary on exceptionally hard woods or problem materials to make more than one pass at various settings to get the desired depth of cut. When making cuts on all four edges of the workpiece, it is advisable to have the first cut on the end of the piece across the grain. Thus, if chipping occurs at the end of a cut, it will be removed when making the next cut parallel with the grain.

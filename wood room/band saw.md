# Bandsaw

The Band Saw can be used to cut all kinds of wood and some types of plastics. Before using
these pieces of equipment please read and make sure you understand the following safety

## Design Function

1. Cutting freehand curves.
2. Ripping stock into thin strips.
3. Cross cutting or ripping stock.
4. Cutting wood and some plastics.

## Safety and Use

* Eye protection is required when using these machines.
* Do not talk with observers while operating these machines.
* Always maintain a 3” margin of safety (Keep hands and body parts away from line of cut).
* Make all adjustments with the power off.
* Do not expose more than 1/2” of blade between material and bottom of upper guide.
* Allow saw to reach full speed before beginning cut.
* Hold stock flat on table top.
* Do not cut stock that does not have a flat surface. (i.e. do not attempt to cut spherical
* Feed stock only as fast as teeth will remove material.
* Avoid backing out of cuts when possible.
* Plan relief cuts in advance – think first.
* Do not make turns too tight – listen for blade twisting.
* If “clicking” noise is heard, SHUT OFF POWER – BLADE MAY BE DAMAGED.
* Stop machine and blade before removing scrap pieces.
* Operate the machine from front side (side with doors). Avoid standing to side of machine.
* Ask for help when cutting long or wide or difficult to handle pieces.
* Saw is for use in cutting wood and some other soft materials (ask makerspace staff).
* Keep hands and body parts away from line of cut.

**Absolutely no metal cutting is allowed on this Band Saw.**

Procedure for using Band Saw

1. Inspect material. It should be flat and free of debris (dirt, nails, screws, etc.)
2. Check blade pitch. Use proper blade for various cuts (ask makerspace staff).
3. Adjust upper guide to within 1/2” above surface of material.
4. For straight cuts set up fence (see attendant for assistance).
5. Turn on saw. Machine should run smoothly with a consistent buzz, report strange noises
6. Feed material while standing directly in front of blade. Avoid standing to side of blade.
7. Keep hands and body parts away from line of cut. Sometimes the blade may "jump"
through the material. This happens sometimes when the blade cuts through a portion of the material that may have a lesser density, thus offering less resistance to cutting. The blade will actually speed up and cut at a greater velocity. If you are near the end of a cut and your fingers are in the line of cut injury could occur.
8. Begin feeding material into blade. Use enough pressure to feed material through blade at
a slow consistent speed. If material smokes or burns report it to lab monitor.
9. If you need to pull material out of blade do so with caution. If blade gets stuck in saw kerf
and pulls out of guides, turn off machine and seek help from lab monitor.
10. For angled cuts check with lab monitor for help.

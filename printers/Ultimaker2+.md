## Ultimakers

###Materials List
| Material  | Pros  |  Cons |
|---|---|---|
| PLA  | Cheap, easy to print, bioplastic  | Less durable then ABS, hard to post-process with solvents  |
|  ABS | Cheap, stronger plastic than PLA, higher heat resistance, good surface finish  |  Harder to print than PLA, higher warpage, poor UV resistance |
|  PETG | Good balance between PLA and ABS. Similar benefits of ABS, but more flexible and easier to print  |  Stringing, bed adhesion more difficult than PLA |
| Nylon (PA)  |  Very strong, durable, good for functional parts, high temperature resistance  | Finicky print behaviors, settings  |
| Polycarbonate (PC)  | High temperature and chemical resistance, good for functional parts  | Hard to print, can be brittle after printing  |
| TPU 95A  |  Extremely flexible material | Slow to print  |

### Operation  

In order to print on the Ultimakers, we ask that users come into the Makerspace with their file(s) on a flash drive in an STL format, which can be exported from all major 3D modeling software packages. We will then look over your design with you and help you figure out the most effective way to print it, or if printing is even the best method to create your design.  

## Formlabs Form 2  

### Introduction  

We also have a Form 2 SLA Printer from Formlabs. This printer uses a UV laser and photosensitive resin to selectively harden the resin in layers to create a model.

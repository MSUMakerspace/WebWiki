We have three of these printers available for students, staff, and faculty at Montana State University to use for both academic and personal projects. Below are the materials available and the costs associated with the use of the printers. ### UItimaker 2+ Materials

Material

Pros

Cons

PLA

Cheap, easy to print, bioplastic

Brittle, hard to post-process with solvents

ABS

Cheap, stronger plastic than PLA, higher heat resistance, good surface finish

Harder to print than PLA, higher warpage, poor UV resistance

PETG

Similar benefits of ABS, but more flexible

Stringing, bed adhesion more difficult than PLA

PA

 Very strong, durable, good for functional parts, high temperature resistance

 Finicky print behaviors, settings

PC

High temperature and chemical resistance, good for functional parts

Hard to print, can be brittle

TPU 95A

Extremely flexible material

Slow to print

\### Operation  In order to print on the Ultimakers, we ask that users come into the Makerspace with their file(s) on a flash drive in an STL format, which can be exported from all major 3D modeling software packages. We will then look over your design with you and help you figure out the most effective way to print it, or if printing is even the best method to create your design.  ## Formlabs Form 2  ### Introduction !\[Form 2 Printer\]({{f:491544}}) Our newest printer is the Form 2 SLA Printer from Formlabs. This printer uses a UV laser and photosensitive resin to selectively harden the resin in layers to create a model. ###  Form 2 Materials
